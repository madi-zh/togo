# Todo list app backend

It is a pet project to learn GOlang (I am also learning Rust, but too slow to do something yet), since emergence of coding agents made me less of a coder. I am not against it, since I use a lot of them in my daily work, but outside of work I enjoy learning new things and relax by developing, not vibe-coding.

In this project: 
- Go files are developed from scratch, the "old" ways, by reading !StackOverflow and official documentation. Crazy right?! 
- For the sake of quick demo I am using docker compose to deploy "infrastructure" for my code. Since i am working on be for the app, FE will be generated by one of those prompt -> product apps.
